## Testing

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development to ensure the stability and reliability of your documentation. Docufy supports various testing methodologies to validate your documentation and ensure it meets the desired standards.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests help verify individual components or functions within your documentation. You can write unit tests using testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha. Ensure that each component of your documentation behaves as expected under different scenarios.

### Integration Testing

Integration tests verify interactions between different components or modules of your documentation. These tests ensure that all parts work together seamlessly. Use tools like Selenium or Cypress to automate integration tests and simulate user interactions.

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end (E2E) testing validates the entire documentation workflow from start to finish. E2E tests simulate real user scenarios, including navigation and interactions with your documentation. Frameworks like Puppeteer or TestCafe can help automate E2E tests and ensure the overall functionality of your documentation.

### Continuous Integration

Integrate testing into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate the testing process. CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions can run tests automatically whenever changes are made to your documentation repository. This ensures early detection of issues and maintains the quality of your documentation.

### Code Coverage

Monitor code coverage to track the percentage of your documentation codebase covered by tests. Tools like Istanbul or Jest provide insights into which parts of your documentation are adequately tested and which areas require additional testing.

### Test Reporting

Generate comprehensive test reports to analyze test results and identify areas for improvement. Tools like Mochawesome or Jest provide detailed test reports with information on passed, failed, and skipped tests, along with code coverage metrics.

By incorporating testing into your documentation development process, you can ensure high quality, reliability, and maintainability of your documentation.
